Sure, let's create a README file for your PowerShell script that sets up a GUI for managing backup and restore operations. This README will explain the purpose of the script, how to set it up, and how to use it, making it clear for anyone who wants to utilize or modify the script.

# PowerShell Backup and Restore GUI

This PowerShell script, titled 'Backups 2.0', creates a Windows Forms GUI application designed for managing backup and restore operations of virtual machines. It provides an interactive and user-friendly interface to perform and monitor backup operations, view status updates, and initiate restore processes.

## Features

- **Interactive GUI**: Easy-to-use interface with clearly labeled controls for user input and operational feedback.
- **Backup Management**: Perform backups with progress tracking through a dynamic progress bar and status updates.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that user inputs for backup names are within specified limits.
- **Planned Restore Functionality**: Placeholder buttons for future development of restore functionality.
- **Graceful Exit**: Safe application termination with confirmation prompts to prevent accidental closures.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows OS with PowerShell 5.1 or higher.
- .NET Framework 4.5 or higher (usually included in Windows 8 and above).

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RedBeret/PowershellCLIMac.git

4. Use the GUI to enter necessary details and manage backup/restore operations.

### Development and Customization

- **Backup Logic**: Integrate with actual backup infrastructure to manage real backups.
