# PowerShell Network Simulator

Welcome to the PowerShell Network Simulator! This comprehensive tool allows you to simulate various network operations using PowerShell scripting. Designed for both learning and teaching, this simulator offers a hands-on approach to understanding networking concepts through PowerShell.

## Introduction

PowerShell, developed by Microsoft, is a versatile scripting language geared toward task automation and configuration management. This simulator leverages PowerShell's powerful cmdlets to emulate common networking tasks, providing an effective learning tool for both new and experienced users.

## Features

- **Ping Simulation**: Tests connectivity to an IP address or hostname.
- **Traceroute Simulation**: Traces the path packets take to a specified destination.
- **Network Configuration**: Displays simulated network configuration details like IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway.
- **DNS Lookup Simulation**: Resolves domain names into IP addresses.
- **Port Scanning**: Identifies open ports on a target IP address.
- **Reverse DNS Lookup Simulation**: Simulates a reverse DNS lookup for an IP address.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
