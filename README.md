# PowerShell Network Simulator

Welcome to the PowerShell Network Simulator! This tool is designed to facilitate a practical understanding of networking concepts using PowerShell. Ideal for both newcomers and seasoned professionals, the simulator serves as a dynamic educational platform to experiment with and demonstrate various network operations.

## Introduction

PowerShell, a robust scripting language developed by Microsoft, excels in task automation and configuration management. This simulator employs PowerShell's extensive cmdlets to mimic common networking tasks, making it an invaluable learning resource.

## Features

- **Ping Simulation**: Mimics connectivity tests to an IP address or hostname.
- **Traceroute Simulation**: Demonstrates the path that packets take to a specified network destination.
- **Network Configuration**: Displays mock network configurations such as IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways.
- **DNS Lookup Simulation**: Resolves domain names to their corresponding IP addresses.
- **Port Scanning**: Detects open ports on a specified IP address.
- **Reverse DNS Lookup Simulation**: Performs a reverse lookup to find the domain associated with an IP address.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Navigate to the Script**: Open your command line interface, navigate to the cloned directory, and initiate PowerShell.
3. **Execute the Script**: Run the `NetworkSimulator.ps1` script with the command:
   ```powershell
   .\NetworkSimulator.ps1
   ```
4. **Interactive Menu**: Utilize the interactive menu to select and execute different simulations.
5. **Experiment and Learn**: Try various commands and observe the results to deepen your understanding of network operations.
6. **Exit the Simulator**: Exit by pressing 'Q' when finished.

## Compatibility

- **Windows**: Fully supported in PowerShell.
- **macOS**: Partial support, as some features may behave differently due to underlying system differences.

## Contributing

Your contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for new features or improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. This project is open to all who wish to expand their knowledge and contribute to community learning.

## Educational Purpose

Please note that this simulator is intended for educational purposes only. All simulations are theoretical and should be used responsibly and ethically within legal and regulatory frameworks.

## Future Directions

- **Expand Simulation Types**: Adding more complex network simulations.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Enhancing support for macOS and possibly other Unix-like systems.
- **Interactive Learning Modules**: Integrating step-by-step tutorials for each simulated operation.
