# PowerShell Network Simulator

Welcome to the PowerShell Network Simulator! This tool allows you to simulate various networking operations using PowerShell scripting. Whether you're learning PowerShell or exploring networking concepts, this simulator provides a hands-on experience.

## Introduction

PowerShell is a powerful scripting language developed by Microsoft, primarily used for task automation and configuration management. It provides cmdlets (pronounced command-lets), which are specialized .NET classes implementing a particular operation. In this simulator, we focus on network-related cmdlets to emulate common networking tasks.

## Features

### 1. Ping Simulation
Simulate a ping operation to test connectivity to an IP address or hostname.

### 2. Traceroute Simulation
Simulate a traceroute operation to trace the path packets take to reach a destination.

### 3. Network Configuration
Display simulated network configuration information such as IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway.

### 4. DNS Lookup Simulation
Simulate a DNS lookup operation to resolve domain names into IP addresses.

### 5. Port Scanning
Simulate a port scan to discover open ports on a target IP address.
