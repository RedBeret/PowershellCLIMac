# PowerShell CLI Network Simulator

This PowerShell script is designed to simulate various network operations including ping, traceroute, DNS lookup, and port scanning. It serves as a tool for educational purposes, allowing users to gain hands-on experience with these network operations in a controlled, simulated environment.

## Features

- **Ping Simulation**: Mimic a ping operation to a specified IP address or hostname.
- **Traceroute Simulation**: Simulate a traceroute to an IP address or hostname to trace the path data packets take to reach an endpoint.
- **DNS Lookup Simulation**: Simulate a DNS lookup to resolve a domain to an IP address.
- **Reverse DNS Lookup Simulation**: Simulate a reverse DNS lookup that finds the hostname associated with a given IP address.
- **Port Scanning Simulation**: Simulate scanning common ports of a specified IP address to determine open ports.
